# Comfy3D

**Comfy3D** is a GPU-accelerated containerized environment for advanced 3D workflows using [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), enhanced with real-time diffusion models like Hunyuan3D, FLUX, and various 3D/ControlNet extensions. 

This setup provides out-of-the-box workflows for generating character sheets, textured meshes, and multi-view renders, all within a reproducible and customizable Docker environment. 

Docker containers are deployed to [https://hub.docker.com/r/michaelgold/comfy3d](https://hub.docker.com/r/michaelgold/comfy3d)

## 🐳 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker with NVIDIA GPU support
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA >= 12.1
- (Optional) VS Code with Dev Containers support

---

### 🏗️ Build & Run Locally

#### Development (hot-reload, volumes mapped):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

#### Production:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
The app runs at http://localhost:8188

#### 🧬 Structure
```pre
├── Docker/                   # Dockerfile and build logic
├── .devcontainer/            # VS Code container dev config
├── workflows/                # JSON workflows for ComfyUI
├── input/                    # Sample input images
├── output/                   # Output directory (mounted)
├── utils/

├── docker-compose.yml        # Production stack
├── docker-compose.dev.yml    # Development stack
└── docker-compose.studio.yml # Studio workstation stack
```

#### 🧠 Models
The following models can be downloaded at runtime with the included [ComfyUI-HF-Model-Downloader](https://github.com/michaelgold/ComfyUI-HF-Model-Downloader) addon:

- Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo: tencent/Hunyuan3D-2
- ControlNet/FLUX Models (via mounted models/ folder)

####  🧪 Sample Workflows
1. Character Sheet (Flux)
workflows/characeter_flux.json

Generates a 1980s video game-style wrestler character from a single image and prompt using FLUX guidance.

2. Single-view Mesh (hy3d.json)
From 1 image (e.g., wrestler-front.png), generates a textured GLB mesh and multiview renders.

3. Multi-view Mesh (hy3d_multiview.json)
From 4 directional views, generates consistent textured 3D mesh with advanced postprocessing and export.

#### 🛠️ VS Code Dev Container
If using VS Code:

Open in container (Dev Containers extension)

Auto-runs utils/init.sh

Installs ComfyUI, custom nodes, and all Python deps in a virtualenv

#### 📤 Output
All images and GLB files are saved to the output/ directory, which is volume-mounted and shared across builds.

#### 📜 License
